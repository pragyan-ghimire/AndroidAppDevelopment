    <string name="generic_text">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</string>

    <string-array name="sports_description">
        <item>Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and fielding. The game occurs over
            the course of several plays, with each play generally beginning when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that
            a player on the batting team, called the batter, tries to hit with a bat.</item>
        <item>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the
            most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played
            as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court.</item>
        <item>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court,
            compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender\'s hoop
            (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the
            opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.</item>
        <item>Bowling is a target sport and recreational activity in which a player rolls a ball toward pins (in pin bowling) or another target
            (in target bowling). The term bowling usually refers to pin bowling (most commonly ten-pin bowling), though in the United Kingdom and
            Commonwealth countries, bowling could also refer to target bowling, such as lawn bowls.</item>
        <item>Cycling, also, when on a two-wheeled bicycle, called bicycling or biking, is the use of cycles for transport, recreation, exercise or
            sport.[1] People engaged in cycling are referred to as "cyclists",[2] "bicyclists",[3] or "bikers".[4] Apart from two-wheeled bicycles,
            "cycling" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadricycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs).</item>
        <item>Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not use a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on
            different courses is a key part of the game. Courses typically have either 18 or 9 holes, regions of terrain that each
            contain a cup, the hole that receives the ball. Each hole on a course contains a teeing ground to start from, and a putting green containing
            the cup.</item>
        <item>Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot. Running is a type of gait
            characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions).[1] This is in contrast to walking,
            where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance
            leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion.</item>
        <item>Association soccer, more commonly known as football or soccer,[a] is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players who primarily
            use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposite
            team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing side.</item>
        <item>Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water, or other liquid, usually for recreation, sport, exercise, or survival.
            Locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs and the body to achieve hydrodynamic thrust that results in directional
            motion. Humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as a survival
            response.[1]</item>
        <item>Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a racket sport derived from tennis but distinguished by its playing surface
            being atop a stationary table, rather than the court on which players stand. Either individually or in teams of two, players take alternating
            turns returning a light, hollow ball over the table\'s net onto the opposing half of the court using small rackets until they fail to do so,
            which results in a point for the opponent.</item>
        <item>Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players
            each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a
            net and into the opponent\'s court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a
            valid return. </item>
